 * @dev A  mintable token that can represent claims on cash flow of arbitrary assets such as dividends, loan repayments, 
 * fee or revenue shares among large numbers of token holders. Anyone can deposit funds, token holders can withdraw 
 * their claims.
 * FundsDistributionToken (FDT) implements the accounting logic. FDT-Extension contracts implement methods for depositing and 
 * withdrawing funds in Ether or according to a token standard such as ERC20, ERC223, ERC777.
